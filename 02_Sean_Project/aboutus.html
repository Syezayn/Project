    Back in the 90s, where photograph was shot in films. My dad will passed his SLR camera to me to shoot our family photograph. 
    As a young boy who was given a SLR camera and tasked to photograph his family trips was a great deal. Unlike having a digital camera,
     I was careful with every shots I made to minimise wastage of films. That was the time, I learned to pay attention to details and anticipate moment. 
     I still remembered the excitement of sending the films for print and collecting the photographs after a few weeks.   
     In year 2009, I brought my first DSLR camera as a hobby to shoot mainly landscape and cityscape.

    One of my best friend then asked me to shoot his wedding in 2010 which I felt really intimidating at that time. 
    But I still went ahead shooting for him. That wedding proved a massive turning point because I enjoyed doing it 
    that I hoped to pursue a career as a professional wedding photographer pretty much straight away. Nothing happen
     immediately as I still have bills to pay so I had to hold on to my full time job. With the wedding portfolio I 
     had I started picking up wedding photography assignment as part time basis. In 2017, I had decided to become a full time
    professional photographer and commit all my time and effort on my couple. I'm grateful that the weddings took off in a short amount of time.
